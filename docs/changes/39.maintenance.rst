- Changed pyvisgen.simulation.visibility.Visibilities dataclass component names from stokes components (I , Q, U, and V) 
  to visibilities constructed from the stokes components (`V_11`, `V_22`, `V_12`, `V_21`)
- Changed indices for stokes components according to AIPS Memo 114
  - Indices will be set automatically depending on simulated polarisation
- Updated comment strings in FITS files
- Updated docstrings accordingly in `pyvisgen.simulation.visibility.vis_loop` and `pyvisgen.simulation.observation.Observation`

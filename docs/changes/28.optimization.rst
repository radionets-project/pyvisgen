- refactor data classes (Visibilities, Baselines)
- add observation class, which holds all relevant information
- drop scan-wise splitting in visibilities calculations, but split all valid baselines equally
- refactor RIME components (currently only uncorrupted available)
- refactor baseline calculations by replacing loops with pytorch built-in methods

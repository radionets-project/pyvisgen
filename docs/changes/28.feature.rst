- implement GPU support for visibility calculations
- new grid mode:
  - when more than one visibility falls into the same pixel, only the first is calculated
  - define grid before calculation
- new dense mode:
  - calculate visibilities for a dense uv grid
  - simulate ideal interferometer response
- add sensitivity cut in image space:
  - avoid calculation of pixel values below detection threshold
  - significantly speed-up simulations
- add torch compile to RIME functions

# pyvisgen [![Actions Status](https://github.com/radionets-project/pyvisgen/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/radionets-project/pyvisgen/actions)

Python implementation of the VISGEN tool developed at [Haystack Observatory](https://www.haystack.mit.edu/astronomy/). It uses the Radio Interferometer Measurement Equation to simulate the measurement process of a radio interferometer. A gridder is also implemented to process the resulting visibilities and convert them to images suitable as input for the neural networks developed in the [radionets repository](https://github.com/radionets-project/radionets).
